          Heart failure is the most common admitting diagnosis in patients over the age of 65.  Heart failure present an enormous economic burden and increasing risk to the aging population. Heart failure is directly associated with increased morbidity and also effects mental health such as depression.

          Minimotifs are vital for normal cell functions and will help bridge the gap between what has changed in an SNP and why that change is important. Understanding SNP effects on minimotifs and the resulting change in function could explain phenotypical changes seen in disease. The resulting intersection of the two domains found 879 results in which a minimotif plays a role in an SNP change. The *879 results* can be further analyzed to show that 189 Distinct Strongest Risk Alleles and 150 distinct SNPs were uncovered.
