          Understanding SNP effects on minimotifs and the resulting change in function could explain phenotypical changes seen in disease. The resulting intersection of the two domains found 879 results in which a minimotif plays a role in an SNP change. The *879 results* can be further analyzed to show that 189 Distinct Strongest Risk Alleles and 150 distinct SNPs were uncovered.

          Since the function of a short contiguous peptide minimotif can be introduced or eliminated by a single point mutation, these functional elements may be a source of human variation and a target of selection. We analyzed the variability of ∼300 000 minimotifs in 1092 human genomes from the 1000 Genomes Project.
