          Heart failure is the most common admitting diagnosis in patients over the age of 65.  Heart failure present an enormous economic burden and increasing risk to the aging population. Heart failure is directly associated with increased morbidity and also effects mental health such as depression.

          Understanding SNP effects on minimotifs and the resulting change in function could explain phenotypical changes seen in disease. The resulting intersection of the two domains found 879 results in which a minimotif plays a role in an SNP change. The *879 results* can be further analyzed to show that 189 Distinct Strongest Risk Alleles and 150 distinct SNPs were uncovered.

          Since the function of a short contiguous peptide minimotif can be introduced or eliminated by a single point mutation, these functional elements may be a source of human variation and a target of selection. We analyzed the variability of ∼300 000 minimotifs in 1092 human genomes from the 1000 Genomes Project.
